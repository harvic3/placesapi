`NodeTskeleton` is a `Clean Arquitecture` based `template project` for `NodeJs` using `TypeScript` to implement with any `web server framework` or even any user interface.

The main philosophy of `NodeTskeleton` is that your solution (`domain` and `application`, `‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù`) should be independent of the framework you use, therefore your code should NOT BE COUPLED to a specific framework or library, it should work in any framework.

The design of `NodeTskeleton` is based in `Clean Arquitecture`, an architecture that allows you to decouple the dependencies of your solution, even without the need to think about the type of `database`, `providers`or `services`, the `framework`, `libraries` or any other dependencies.

`NodeTskeleton` has the minimum `tools` necessary for you to develop the `domain` of your application, you can even decide not to use its included tools (you can remove them), and use the libraries or packages of your choice.

## Philosophy üßòüèΩ

Applications are generally developed to be used by people, so people should be the focus of them.

For this reason `user stories` are written, stories that give us information about the type of user `(role)`, procedures that the user performs in a part of the application `(module)`, important information that serves to `structure the solution` of our application, and in practice, how is this?

The user stories must be in the `src/application` path of our solution, there we create a directory that we will call `modules` and inside this, we create a directory for the task role, for example (customer, operator, seller, admin, ...) and inside the role we create a directory of the corresponding use case module, for example (product, order, account, sales, ...), and in practice that looks more or less like this:
